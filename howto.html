        <p class="lead"> Hello! Welcome to my tutorial to get you up
		and running with the Spotify Web API, so that you can incorporate
		it into your next web project. Though the Spotify Web API has a good amount
		of documentation, my tutorial will walk you through, step-by-step through
		some of the concepts and code that is not presented or thoroughly explained
		in their documentation. BeforeBefore we get going, I first want to give
		an overview of what I will be covering in this tutorial.</p>
		
		<h3>Tutorial Topics:</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>Getting Started</b> - This section will give you links to the existing web resources
			for the Spotify Web API.</li>
			<li><b>Getting Authorized</b> - In order to use any of the Spotify Web API endpoints,
			you need to be authorized. In this section, I will walk through the authorization process
			and how it needs to be implemented in your code.</li>
			<li><b>Understanding Scopes</b> - Permission to all objects </li>
			<li><b>GET Tracks</b> - abicauhpeoafhep</li>
