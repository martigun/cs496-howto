		<br/><br/>
		<h1>Welcome!</h1><br>
		
        <p class="lead"> Hello! Welcome to my tutorial to get you up
		and running with the Spotify Web API. Though the Spotify Web API has some decent
		documentation, my tutorial will walk you through the step-by-step process of setting
		up a node.js server that communicates with the Spotify Web API. By the end 
		of this tutorial, we will have built a simple web page, using node.js as the 
		back-end framework.</p>
		
		<p class="lead">For the purposes of this tutorial, I am going to do all of the development of
		the node.js server locally on my machine through localhost port 3000. Though I will migrate my app to the cloud
		at the end, the focus of this tutorial will be on development and not necessarily how to set up a virtual
		machine in the cloud.</p>
		
		<p class="lead">Before we get going, I first want to give
		an overview of what I will be covering in this tutorial.</p>
		
		<h3>Tutorial Topics:</h3>
		<ul class="lead">
			<li><b>Getting Started</b> - This section will give you links to the existing web resources
			for the Spotify Web API.</li>
			<li><b>Support Files</b> - These files are necessary in our tutorial to be able to support the server file, which will
			be communicating with the API.</li>
			<li><b>server.js</b> - This is the node.js file that will be communicating with the Spotify Web API. </li>
			<li><b>Tracks API</b> - This function within server.js will show how to communicate with the tracks API.</li>
			<!--<li><b>Albums API</b> - This function within server.js will show how to communicate with the albums API.</li>
			<li><b>Artists API</b> - This function within server.js will show how to communicate with the artists API.</li>-->
		</ul>
		
		<p class="lead"> Hopefully you find this guide helpful!</p>
		
		<p id="sect08"></p>
		<br/><br/>
		<h1>Getting Started</h1><br>
		
		<p class="lead"> The very first thing you should do as you get started is to go 
		to <a href="http://spotify.com">spotify.com</a> and create a free account. Look up your favorite 
		musicians and add some of their songs to your library. Having songs in your library will be 
		important for later steps of our tutorial. Next, you need to do will be to review Spotify's
		<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/"> Web API User Guide </a>.
		This will give you a decent overview of what the API offers.</p>
		
		<em class="mybold"></em>
		
		<p class="lead">Next, you will need to work through the
		<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/">Beginner's Tutorial</a>.
		The most important things you will need from the Beginner's Tutorial that you will need for this one:</p>
		
		<ul class="lead">
			<li>Make sure that <b>node.js</b> is installed on your machine</li>
			<li>Make sure you have a Spotify appliation created and registered</li>
			<li>Make sure you have your <b>Client ID</b> and your <b>Client Secret</b> from your application</li>
			<li>Make sure you have a redirect URI for <b>http://localhost:3000/callback</b></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p id="sect12"></p>
		<br/><br/>
		<h1>Support Files</h1><br>
		
		<p class="lead">Now that you've got some light experience with the API and node.js, 
		let's start building our app! We will start by creating the below support files/directory:<p>
		
		<ul class="lead">
			<li>spot (directory)</li>
			<li>index.html (html file)</li>
			<li>package.json (Javascript object notation file)</li>
			<li>helper.js (Javascript file)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="lead"> First, we will create a directory somewhere on our local or virtual machine. My directory
		is named <b>spot</b> and is located at <b>C:\nodeprojects\spot</b> . Next, create a text file within <b>spot</b>
		and name it <b>index.html</b>. Open the file, paste in the code below, and save the file.</p>
		
		<pre> <!--index.html-->
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;SpotApp&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;My Spot App&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;button id=&quot;login_btn&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;br/&gt;
		&lt;button id=&quot;getToken_btn&quot;&gt;Get Token&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;br/&gt;
		&lt;button id=&quot;tracksAPI_btn&quot;&gt;Run Tracks API&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;hr/&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Access Token:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p id=&quot;accessToken&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;hr/&gt;
		&lt;script src=&quot;helper.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
		 </pre>
		
		<p class="lead"> This is our very simple HTML file. Since the focus of this tutorial is going to be focused on
		the back-end server communicating with the API, our simple HTML page will only serve a a "control panel" of 
		sorts for us to jump to the different routes on the back-end to link up with the API.</p>
		
		<p class="lead"> Next, it is time to get the
		<b>package.json</b> file. This file will give us all the necessary dependencies that we 
		will need to install the node modules necessary for running our app. Find the file <b>package.json</b> 
		from the tutorial that you completed and paste a copy of it into the <b>spot</b> directory.
		The file <b>package.json</b> should include the code below. </p>
		
		<pre><!--package.json-->
{
  "author": "Doozer",
  "name": "web-api-code-example",
  "description": "Basic examples of the Spotify authorization flows through oAuth2",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.15.0",
    "cookie-parser": "1.3.2",
    "express": "~4.0.0",
    "querystring": "~0.2.0",
    "request": "~2.34.0"
  }
}
		</pre>
		
		<p class="lead">
		Now that we have the file <b>package.json</b> in this directory we can run 
		<code>npm install</code> in order to install all of the node modules on this machine. 
		To run <code>npm install</code>, we will need to open the command prompt (if you are not 
		already in it). For Windows, the command prompt can be opened by pressing Windows+R, then
		running <code>cmd</code>. From the command prompt, navigate to the <b>spot</b> directory by
		using the <code>cd</code> command. For example, I would type <code>cd C:\nodeprojects\spot</code> 
		in the command prompt and hit Enter. Next enter <code>npm install</code> in the 
		command prompt and hit Enter. This might take a minute or two. After finishing,
		the command prompt should display to you details regarding each of the four modules 
		that were loaded onto your machine. You could be able to navigate to the new 
		<b>node_modules</b> directory by entering <code>cd node_modules</code> in the command prompt
		and then hitting Enter. You may close out of the command prompt now.
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		The last file we are going to create before we get to the star of the show 
		is going to be the <b>helper.js</b> file. This file's primary purpose is to help us with our
		routes and storing/accessing our access token (which we will get into later). I found that very little
		work can be done with this API without having an access token. Since the goal of
		this tutorial was to focus on the back-end interface, with the API, I took some "short-cuts"
		on the front end in order to keep the code as simple as possible. Create a new text file in
		our <b>spot</b> directory, rename it <b>helper.js</b>, and paste the code in below.
		</p>
		
		<pre><!--helper.js-->
//Part 1: establish listeners
document.getElementById("login_btn").addEventListener("click", function(){
	
	//direct to login
	window.location.assign("/login");
});

document.getElementById("tracksAPI_btn").addEventListener("click", function(){
	
	//direct to tracks with token on the end
	window.location.assign("/tracks/" + getToken());
});

document.getElementById("getToken_btn").addEventListener("click", getToken);

//Part 2: get the access token from the URL
function getToken(){

	//start with the current URL string
	var CurrentAccessToken = window.location.href;

	//find #access_token= in the string
	var string_to_find = "#access_token=";

	//get start_from index
	var start_from = CurrentAccessToken.search(string_to_find);
	
	//only run if #access_token= is found
	if(start_from > 0){
		
		//add length of #access_token= to the start_from index
		start_from += string_to_find.length;

		//set CurrentAccessToken through the end
		CurrentAccessToken = CurrentAccessToken.substr(start_from,CurrentAccessToken.length);
		document.getElementById("accessToken").textContent = CurrentAccessToken;
		
		//return the Token
		return CurrentAccessToken;
	} else {
		
		//if not found, return NULL
		return NULL;
	}	
}
		</pre>
		
		<p class="lead">
		Part 1 of the code above simply establishes listeners. We have a listener for each one
		of our buttons. We have a <b>Login</b> button and a
		<b>Get Token</b> button and also buttons that demonstrate each of the APIs.
		The listener for login simply points to the "/login" route. The rest of the listeners depend on Part 2 of the code.
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		Part 2 of the code above pulls the access token out of the URL so that it can be used by routes.
		The <b>Get Token</b> button looks at the current URL of the page to see if the <b>access_token</b> is available in
		the query string. If it is available, the function that is run when the <b>Get Token</b> button is clicked will
		copy that string into the HTML page within the paragraph <code>id="accessToken"</code>. Finally, whenever one of the
		API buttons is clicked, the route that is taken will include the <b>access_token</b>. For example, if the access_token is
		currently <code>xyzACCESSTOKENxyz</code>, and we can see that token in the URL, when the <b>Get Token</b> button is pushed
		the token will be copied into the HTML page. Then, when the <b>Run Tracks API</b> button is pushed, the route 
		<code>/tracks/xyzACCESSTOKENxyz</code> will run. I set up this tutorial this way because each API requires an
		access token to be able to run.
		</p>

		<br/><br/>
		<h1>server.js File</h1><br>
		
		<p class="lead"> Next is arguably the most important file, <b>server.js</b>.
		This Javascript file will be the back-end server that will display our web page and 
		also communicate with the Spotify API. Create a new text file in the <b>spot</b> directory. 
		Rename this file <b>server.js</b>, paste in the code below, and save.</p>
		
		<pre><!--server.js-->
//Part 1
//node.js libraries that are required
var express = require('express'); // Express web server framework
var request = require('request'); // "Request" library
var querystring = require('querystring');

var client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE'; // Your client id
var client_secret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_GOES_HERE'; // Your client secret
var redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:3000/callback'; // Your redirect uri

var app = express(); //initiates express 

app.use(express.static(__dirname)); //searches the current directory for html

//Part 2
//this route will run when login is clicked
app.get('/login',function(req,res){
	
	//establishing scopes
	var scope = 'user-read-private';
	scope += ' user-read-email'
	scope += ' user-library-read'
	
	//Part 3
	//call the authorize endpoint
	res.redirect('https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?' +
	querystring.stringify({
		response_type: 'code',
		client_id: client_id,
		scope: scope,
		redirect_uri: redirect_uri
	}));
	
	//Part 4
	//route to our redirect uri
	app.get('/callback', function(req, res){
		
		//set up object to pass token endpoint
		var authOptions = {
			url: 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
			form: {
				code: req.query.code,
				redirect_uri: redirect_uri,
				grant_type: 'authorization_code'
			},
			headers: {
				'Authorization': 'Basic ' + (new Buffer(client_id + ':' + client_secret).toString('base64'))
			},
			json: true
		};
		
		//Part 5
		//post our new object to the token endpoint
		request.post(authOptions, function(error, response, body) {
			
			//establish access token
			var access_token = body.access_token;

			//push our new tokens to the browser
			res.redirect('/#' +
				querystring.stringify({
					access_token: access_token
			}));
		});
	});
});

/*API calls will go here*/

console.log("Listening on 3000...");
app.listen(3000);
		</pre>
		
		<p class="lead">Let's break this code down part by part.</p>
		
		<p class="lead"><b>Part 1</b></p>
		<p class="lead">
		Part 1 is all the libraries that this code needs to function. All of these libraries should be installed in your <b>spot/node_modules</b> directory. <b>Express</b> is the web application framework for Node.js that we will use to handle the set-up of our server and our routing. We include the <b>express</b> library with the code <code>var express = require('express');</code> and initiate the web application with <code>var app = express();</code>. We also utilize the libraries <b>request</b> and <b>querystring</b> and include them with the code <code>var request = require('request');</code> and <code>var querystring = require('querystring');</code>, respectively. Next, we have string variables for <b>client_id</b> and <b>client_secret</b>. You should substitute the text 
		<code>YOUR_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE</code> with the text string of your client id by going to <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/">My Applications</a> and copying your client id. You should do the same with the text <code>YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_GOES_HERE</code> with the client secret. The next variable is the <b>redirect_uri</b>, which we will set to be <code>var redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:3000/callback';</code> so that when the authentication redirects back to our site (discussed below), it goes to this handler. Finally, we have the code <code>app.use(express.static(__dirname));</code>, which instructs the server to look in this directory (ie. <b>spot</b>) to find the static html files to load when this <b>server.js</b> file is up and running.
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead"><b>Part 2</b></p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		For the next 3 parts, things start to get interesting! We will be setting up the authentication process, so that your app has a token to use to be able to make requests to the API. Simply put, the authentication process for the spotify API goes as follows: 
			<ul class="lead">
				<li>A <b>get</b> request is sent to the API endpoint <b>authorize</b></li>
				<li>The <b>authorize</b> endpoint returns to the <b>redirect_uri</b> with the authorization code in the request</li>
				<li>The authorization code is sent via a <b>post</b> ruquest to the API endpoint <b>api/token</b></li>
				<li>Finally, the <b>access_token</b> is giving in the body of the response of the post</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="lead">
		First we have the server call a <b>get</b> request to the route <b>/login</b> with the code <code>app.get('/login',function(req,res){...</code> This works by the <b>app.get</b> function taking 2 arguments. The first arugment is the route and the second argument is a function, with request and result variables passed in as the two parameters. The rest of the code for this <b>login/</b> route will live inside of the function passed into this <b>app.get</b> request. Also within Part 2, we establish an important variable <code>var scope</code>. This variable we will pass into the authorize endpoint in order to get authentication back. You can learn more about scopes within this API <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/">here</a>. For now, set the <b>scope</b> variable equal to the value in the code above. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead"><b>Part 3</b></p>
		<p class="lead">
		It is time to make our first API endpoint request! We will initiate the <b>get</b>  request by redirecting to the <b>authorize</b> API endpoint with the code <code>res.redirect('https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?'...</code>. We will be passing the following parameters to the API through the query string:
		</p>
		
		<ul class="lead">
			<li>response type (code, since we want code back)</li>
			<li>client_id (which we already established at the top of our code)</li>
			<li>scope (which we established on Part2)</li>
			<li>redirect_uri (which we also established at the top of our code)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="lead">
		We pass these into the query string by using the <code>querystring.stringify(...</code> function. The end result is:
		</p>
		
		<pre>
res.redirect('https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?' +
querystring.stringify({
	response_type: 'code',
	client_id: client_id,
	scope: scope,
	redirect_uri: redirect_uri
}));
		</pre>
		
		<p class="lead"><b>Part 4</b></p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		After we sent off our request to the <b>athorize</b> endpoint, the request should return to the <b>redirect_uri</b> that we passed into the request. Since we passed in <b>'http://localhost:3000/callback'</b>, we will set up a <b>get</b> request at that route in our file with the code <code>app.get('/callback', function(req, res){...</code>. Once again, we are using a <b>get</b> call, with has 2 parameters, one for the route and the other for the function that executes (which has 2 parameters itself: one for the request and one for the resopnse). The first thing that we do within our function is to create an object called <code>var authOptions = {...</code>. This object will store all of the information that we need to post to our <b>api/token</b> endpoint, including the URI of the endpoint. All the items in the object are string constants or established in the above code, except for the field <b>code</b> within the <b>form</b> object. For the <b>code</b> field, we will load it with the authorization code that came back from the <b>authorize</b> endpoint by using <code>req.query.code</code>. The final <b>authOptions</b> object looks like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
var authOptions = {
	url: 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
	form: {
		code: req.query.code,
		redirect_uri: redirect_uri,
		grant_type: 'authorization_code'
	},
	headers: {
		'Authorization': 'Basic ' + (new Buffer(client_id + ':' + client_secret).toString('base64'))
	},
	json: true
};
		</pre>
		
		<p class="lead"><b>Part 5</b></p>

		<p class="lead">
			On to Part 5, so we can wrap this authorization part up! This section of code takes the <b>authOptions</b> object that we created earlier a executes a <b>post</b> request the endpoint specified within the object. Within the body of that response will be the access token that we were working toward attaining the entire time. Finally, we redirect the site to the root and push the <b>access_token</b> into the query string so it can be used by the browser to make calls to other APIs. We push the <b>access_token</b> into the query string with the code <code>res.redirect('/#' + querystring.stringify({access_token:access_token}));</code>.
		</p>

		
		<p class="lead"></p>
		
		<p id="sect20"></p>
		<br/><br/>
		<h1>Tracks API</h1><br>
		
		<p class="lead">
		Now that we've done all the hard stuff, building the APIs will be relatively easy.
		Paste the code below into server.js where the code says <code>/*API calls will go here*/</code>.
		</p>
		
		<pre><!--server.js#tracks-->
app.get('/tracks/:token',function(req,res){
	
	//get token from request
	var access_token = req.params.token;
	
	//set up options
	var options = {
		url: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks?limit=10',
		headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token },
		json: true
	};
	
	// use the access token to access the Spotify Web API
	request.get(options, function(error, response, body) {

		//print 10 track names to console
		for(var i=0;i<10;i++) console.log(body.items[i].track.name);
	});
	
	//put token back into browser
	res.redirect('/#' +
		querystring.stringify({
			access_token: access_token
	}));
});
		</pre>
		</pre>
		</pre>
	
		<p class="lead">
		As we discussed earlier, we will make this call by passing in the access token as part of the
		GET request. Since the token is a parameter of the get request, it is easily accessible to be
		placed into and used for the tracks API. As we can see above, with this API, we have limited
		the tracks to 10. Next, we have printed all ten of these track names to the console.
